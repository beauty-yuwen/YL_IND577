In this file, I will discuss the Preceptron. In machine learning and artificial neural networks, Perceptron is one of the most basic artificial neuron models for binary classification tasks.
A perceptron consists of four parts: input values, weights and a bias, a weighted sum, and activation function.
Also, the file will include the dataset used to implement the algorithm. By doing this, it can help me understand the algorithm more clearly.
