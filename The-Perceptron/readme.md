In this file, I will discuss the Preceptron. In machine learning and artificial neural networks, Perceptron is one of the most basic artificial neuron models for binary classification tasks.
A perceptron consists of four parts: input values, weights and a bias, a weighted sum, and activation function. The activation function takes the weighted sum and bias as input.

Just as the picture shows, we can assume there are three input values: X1, X2 and X3. The weights are W1,W2 and W3. Neuron means the activation function. Y is the output value.
Also, the file will include the dataset used to implement the algorithm. By doing this, it can help me understand the algorithm more clearly.
In this file, I will use 'diabetes' as my dataset to do the Perceptron.
