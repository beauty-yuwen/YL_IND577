Neural Nets
===========
In this file, I will introduce Neural Nets in machine learning.

What is Neural Nets?
------------------
Neural networks, are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are a subset of machine learning algorithms that are particularly well-suited for tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, regression, and decision making.

The basic building block of a neural network is the artificial neuron, also known as a perceptron. Neurons are organized into layers, and these layers form the structure of the neural network. There are typically three types of layers:

### Input Layer:
This layer receives input features or data and passes them to the next layer.
### Hidden Layers:
These layers lie between the input and output layers.
Neurons in hidden layers apply weighted transformations to the inputs and pass the results to the next layer.
### Output Layer:
This layer produces the final output of the neural network.
The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task (e.g., binary classification, multiclass classification, regression).
