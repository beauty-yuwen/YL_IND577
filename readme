In this file, I will discuss the Preceptron. In machine learning and artificial neural networks, Perceptron is one of the most basic artificial neuron models for binary classification tasks.
Also, the file will include the dataset used to implement the algorithm. By doing this, it can help me understand the algorithm more clearly.
