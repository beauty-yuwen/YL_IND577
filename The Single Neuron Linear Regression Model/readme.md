The Single Neuron Linear Regression Model
========================================
In this file, the Single Neuron Linear Regression Model will be introduced.

Regression and Linear Regression
--------------------------------
Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes used to estimate the relationship between a "response" variable, ("label" in machine learning) and one or more independent variables ("features"). One of the most common uses of regression analysis is prediction. The rules between "labels" and "features" are obtained by supervised learning on a training set of data. Afterwards, a "feature" can be entered and its "label" can be predicted.

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which the rule between "label" and "feature" is used to find the straight line that best matches the rule.
