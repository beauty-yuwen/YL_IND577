# Rice INDE 577 Data Science & Machine learning
This repository contains algorithms taught in INDE 577 during fall semester of 2023.
This repo discusses supervised and unsupervised learning.

### In Supervised Learning, I learnedï¼š
* Decision Trees
* Ensemble methods
* Gradient_Descent
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* The-Perceptron
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines.
### In Unsupervised Learning, I learned:
* Principal Component Analysis
* k-Means Clustering
### I have introduced every alogrithm clearly and used real data sets to implement them.

## Data sets used in this repo:
* Loan_data
* Titanic_data
* College_data
* Cancer_data
* NBA_data
### By using these data sets, I can implement these alogrithms. Besides, I have uploaded these data sets and I have given data description in every file.
